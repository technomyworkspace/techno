By default, SSH on Ubuntu comes configured in a way that disables the root users log in. 
This was originally enabled as a security precaution which means that you cannot directly log in as the root user over SSH. 
However, you can usually get around the need for root ssh login by using the sudo command. 
In some cases, though itâ€™s just more convenient to get directly logged in as root.

Enable root login over SSH

1. vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2. PermitRootLogin yes  (add this line anyhwere)
3. systemctl restart sshd
4.PermitRootLogin without-password

to password less login we have to add (PasswordAuthentication yes) to sshd_config file
